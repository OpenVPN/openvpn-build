ovpn-backports (20250423-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New package ovpn-dkms
    - This is an out-of-tree backport of the ovpn module
      from Linux 6.16+ to older kernels. It replaces the
      previous ovpn-dco module (package openvpn-dco-dkms),
      but can be installed in parallel.
      OpenVPN 2.6.x is only compatible with the old module,
      OpenVPN 2.7.x is only compatbile with the new module.
