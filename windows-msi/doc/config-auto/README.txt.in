This directory or its subdirectories should contain @PRODUCT_NAME@
configuration files each having an extension of .@CONFIG_EXTENSION@
that should be automatically started at boot up.

When @PRODUCT_NAME@Service is started, a separate @PRODUCT_NAME@
process will be instantiated for each configuration file.

@PRODUCT_NAME@ GUI scans this directory and its subdirectories for
configuration files and lists them under the "Persistent Profiles"
menu unless that feature is turned off. If @PRODUCT_NAME@ PLAP dll
is registered, these configurations are also accessible from the login
screen for "Start Before Logon".
