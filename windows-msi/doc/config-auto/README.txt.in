This directory or its subdirectories should contain @PRODUCT_NAME@
configuration files each having an extension of .@CONFIG_EXTENSION@
that should be automatically started at boot up.

When @PRODUCT_NAME@Service is started, a separate @PRODUCT_NAME@
process will be instantiated for each configuration file.

@PRODUCT_NAME@ GUI does not scan this directory.
