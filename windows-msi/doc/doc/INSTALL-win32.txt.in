GENERAL QUICKSTART FOR WINDOWS

OpenVPN requires a configuration file and key/certificate files. You should 
obtain these and save them to OpenVPN's configuration directory, usually 
C:\Program Files\@PRODUCT_NAME@\config. Starting with OpenVPN 2.4-alpha1 you can also 
put user-specific configurations to %USERPROFILE%\OpenVPN\config when using 
OpenVPN GUI.

You can run OpenVPN as a Windows system service, by using OpenVPN GUI or from a 
command-prompt. To use the OpenVPN GUI, double click on the desktop icon or 
start menu icon. OpenVPN GUI is a system-tray applet, so an icon for the GUI 
will appear in the lower-right corner of the screen. Right click on the system 
tray icon, and a menu should appear showing the names of your OpenVPN 
configuration files, and giving you the option to connect. Starting in OpenVPN 
2.4-alpha1 admin privileges are no longer required for launching OpenVPN 
connections using configuration files stored in the global config directory 
(usually C:\Program Files\@PRODUCT_NAME@\config). Users who belong to the built-in 
administrator group, or to the local "OpenVPN Administrator" group can also 
store configuration files under %USERPROFILE%\OpenVPN\config. In both of these 
cases OpenVPN Interactive Service needs to be running: if it is not, 
administrator privileges are still required to successfully start OpenVPN 
connections. For further details please refer to OpenVPN GUI documentation:

    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui

OpenVPN 2.4-alpha1 and later come bundled with three system services:

    OpenVPNService (new, improved background service)
    OpenVPNServiceInteractive (required to run GUI as non-admin)
    OpenVPNServiceLegacy (deprecated background service)

The installer starts OpenVPNServiceInteractive automatically and configures it 
to start at system startup. This is done to allow unprivileged users to start 
OpenVPN connections using OpenVPN GUI without any extra configuration.

OpenVPNService is based on openvpnserv2, a complete rewrite of the OpenVPN 
service wrapper. It is intended for launching OpenVPN instances that should be 
up at all times, instead of being manually launched by a user. OpenVPNService is 
able to restart individual OpenVPN processes if they crash, and it also works 
properly on recent Windows versions. OpenVPNServiceLegacy tends to work poorly, 
if at all, on newer Windows versions (8+) and its use is not recommended.
