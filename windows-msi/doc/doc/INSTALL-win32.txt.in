GENERAL QUICKSTART FOR WINDOWS

OpenVPN requires a configuration file and key/certificate files. You should
obtain these and save them to one of OpenVPN's configuration directories:

    C:\Program Files\@PRODUCT_NAME@\config (global configs)
    C:\Program Files\@PRODUCT_NAME@\config-auto (autostarted global configs)
    %USERPROFILE%\OpenVPN\config (per-user configs)

For launching OpenVPN Connections you have two main options:

    OpenVPN GUI (tray applet)
    OpenVPNService (system service, not installed by default)

OpenVPN GUI is used to launching VPN connections on demand. The OpenVPNService
launches all configs under config-auto during boot and should be used for
persistent OpenVPN connections that are not tied to any particular user
session.

OPENVPN GUI

To launch an OpenVPN connection double click on the OpenVPN GUI desktop icon or
start menu icon. OpenVPN GUI is a system-tray applet, so an icon for the GUI
will appear in the lower-right corner of the screen. Right click on the system
tray icon, and a menu should appear showing the names of your OpenVPN
configuration files, and giving you the option to connect.

Admin privileges are not required for launching OpenVPN connections using
configuration files stored in the global config directory Users who belong to
the built-in administrator group, or to the local "OpenVPN Administrator" group
can also store configuration files under %USERPROFILE%\OpenVPN\config. In both
of these cases OpenVPN Interactive Service needs to be running: if it is not,
administrator privileges are still required to successfully start OpenVPN
connections. For further details please refer to OpenVPN GUI documentation:

    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn-gui

SYSTEM SERVICES

OpenVPN 2.5-beta1 and later come bundled with two system services:

    OpenVPNService (background service, not installed by default)
    OpenVPNServiceInteractive (required to run GUI as non-admin)

The installer starts OpenVPNServiceInteractive automatically and configures it
to start at system startup. This is done to allow unprivileged users to start
OpenVPN connections using OpenVPN GUI without any extra configuration.

OpenVPNService is based on openvpnserv2, a complete rewrite of the OpenVPN
service wrapper. It is intended for launching OpenVPN instances that should be
up at all times, instead of being manually launched by a user. OpenVPNService
is able to restart individual OpenVPN processes if they crash, and it also
works properly on recent Windows versions.
